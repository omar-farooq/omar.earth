### Description

Website for a housing co-op that I've lived in and been a part of.

### About

Living in a housing co-op can have its ups and downs - the main advantages being that people can contribute to a higher quality of life while also maintaining a simpler lifestyle - something that society should itself provide. The downside can be lack of communication, sorting paperwork and organising repairs and purchases, particularly when you have quite a few people living in the same building. There may be times when something urgent happens but it's not effectively communicated and this is where it's important to have a platform for sharing such information.

### Preview

The website allows people to document minutes from meetings and easily search them; To request purchases; Vote on matters; Advertise vacancies; Create treasury plans; Document treasury items and more.
