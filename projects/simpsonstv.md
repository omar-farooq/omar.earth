### Description

A Simpsons website with a relatively innovative design (think what websites looked like in 2004).

The site had a lot of information on the show including an episode guide, couch gags, many lists of things like cut scenes, biographies, quizzes, downloads, news and plenty of images almost ALL drawn by me using flash. Back in the day it wasn't possible to just take a screen grab of a clip because the quality was too poor.

The site was around the top 10 of the best Simpsons websites of the time although I had big plans to make it MUCH better. Those plans never materialised but the site would probably still be considered decent by today's standards, although lacking in about a decades worth of episodes.

### About

The design was made around 2003-2004 and the site itself was constructed by making the whole page as an image in Macromedia Fireworks, splicing the image into different sections and even adding hyperlinks to the navigation section when splitting up the images. I then put each unique image into a table, either as an image or as a background image if it was repeating. The main design was basically template for every page and the text itself was altered in the main body using a php include code, the very same used to show the text you're reading right now!

Note: Each image on the design was drawn by me.

This was my second real project, my first being a poorly constructed home page with its own domain name but a great flash intro. This site originally started on a domain name called bartofwar.com but I eventually decided that I needed a catchier domain and better design so I eventually came up with this.

It was something that I enjoyed making in my spare time and this was the last design I had in place. bartofwar.com was probably made when I was about 13 or 14 and this was when I was about 15 up until I reached around 16 and had exams and a job, leaving me with little time to web design.

The Simpsons was my favourite show and still is, although I'm not quite so fanatical about it these days, I still enjoy watching it but I don't look out for the finer details anymore, possibly because it's gone on for so much longer than I ever could have expected.

### Preview

As I mentioned, all images were drawn by me and here is an image I drew to celebrate the 300th episode.
