### Description

A website made for an amateur frisbee group. 

### About

The website was made with raw php (no framework), html, css and jquery, although the design was the main reason for it. There is some code on my github page which shows how a shop was made using a paypal developer library to allow people to buy items and how I utilised OAuth to enable users to register with their facebook account (and had my own feature to allow people to register/login). This led to me getting a job in Identity Access Management.

Modern frameworks and tooling mean that such a website could be made a lot faster and with a lot less code and effort, which is great for people that want to make websites!
